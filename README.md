# NET.S.2018.Kononenko.15

1. Make corrections to generalized methods of binary search, filter method, transformer method - to implement as generalized extension methods, as well as the method of finding the n-first numbers of the Fibonacci sequence - to implement as a sequence generator.[watch here](https://github.com/AlexanderKononenko210b/NET.S.2018.Kononenko.14.git)

2. Make corrections to the generalized collection-class Queue.[watch here](https://github.com/AlexanderKononenko210b/NET.S.2018.Kononenko.01.git)

3. Develop a generic collection-class BinarySearchTree (binary search tree). To provide for the possibility of using a plug-in interface for the implementation of order relations. Implement three ways of traversing the tree: direct (preorder), transverse (inorder), reverse (post-operational): for implementation use the block iterator (revenue). Test the developed class using the following types:
- System.Int32 (use default comparison and connectable comparator);
- System.String (use default comparison and plug-in comparator);
- user class Book, for objects that are implemented order relations (use the default comparison and connectable comparator);
- user's Point structure, for objects that do not implement an order relation (use a plug-in comparator).
